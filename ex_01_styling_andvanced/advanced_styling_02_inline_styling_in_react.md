# Inline Styling in React

Same as there is a special to write HTML (**JSX**), there is a special way to write inline styles.

It is also similar, just bear in mind we'll need other keywords so we don't overwrite any built in react words.

```
this.customStyles = {
  content: {
    top: "50%",
    left: "50%",
    right: "auto",
    marginRight: "-50%",
    transform: "translate(-50%, -50%),
    width: "800px"
  }
};
```
