# Mixin for a Form

First, we should remember that that mixins are like classes, prototypes that will need to be called from somewhere else later on. So, we create the mixin with a name of "mixin_name" and all the styles we want, and then in our actual class we do **"include mixin_name"** for those styles to apply.
